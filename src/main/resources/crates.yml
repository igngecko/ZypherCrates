# Define your virtual crate types here for ZypherCrates.
# Each top-level key is the internal name (ID) of the crate.
# This ID is used in commands (/zc give <player> <crate_id>) and permissions (zyphercrates.open.<crate_id>).
# Crate IDs should be simple, lowercase, alphanumeric, no spaces (use underscores or hyphens if needed).
